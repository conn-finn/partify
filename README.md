### Description
basically just an app that makes viewing & listening to songs on spotify more fun. the idea is to generate some sort of unique visual for every song you play automatically.

### Progress
currently creates an html file with the album cover, name, etc. of the currently playing track, as well as update the file whenever a new song begins to play.

### Notes
* get song info - spotify api (new project)
	+ Album cover
	+ artist images via google images search?
* music video - youtube api
	+ how to line up with correct time? match close captioning?
* bpm
* some visualization of equalizer
* random effects
* lyrics - genius api
* maybe DJ songs together with fade and finding similar bpm and song suggestions
